## PGA Tour Stats Database

Using data from the [**PGA Tour**](https://www.pgatour.com/stats) website, I have created a database of the 2022/23 season player statistics (update as of June 21st).

[![PGA Tour Website](images/pga_tour_website.png)](https://www.pgatour.com/stats)

### Database connection

```{r database connections}

pga_stats <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "pga_stats.db")
)

DBI::dbListTables(pga_stats)

```

### Formatting & cleaning tables

Here, we create dataframes from the database connection, and use `janitor::clean_names()` to tidy the column names. Following, I've manually changed some of the column names - this will make it much clearer to readers later in my analysis.

```{r database formatting}

birdies <- data.frame(
  dplyr::tbl(pga_stats, "birdies_per_round")
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

driving <- data.frame(
  dplyr::tbl(pga_stats, "driving_distance")
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

gir <- data.frame(
  dplyr::tbl(pga_stats, "gir_pct")
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

scoring <- data.frame(
  dplyr::tbl(pga_stats, "scoring_avg")
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

scrambling <- data.frame(
  dplyr::tbl(pga_stats, "scrambling_pct")
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```

```{r cleaning tables}

birdies <- birdies %>% 
  select(-movement) %>% 
  rename(birdies_per_round = avg)

driving <- driving %>% 
  select(-movement) %>% 
  rename(driving_avg = avg)

gir <- gir %>% 
  select(-movement) %>% 
  rename(gir_pct = x)

scoring <- scoring %>% 
  select(-movement) %>% 
  rename(scoring_avg = avg)

scrambling <- scrambling %>% 
  select(-movement) %>% 
  rename(scrambling_pct = x)

```

## Data Visualisations

Before I commence with some exploratory data anaylsis, let's clearly define all of our variables of interest:

| Variable          | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| player            | Player's name                                                                                 |
| rank              | Player's PGA Tour rank in the variable of interest                                            |
| birdies_per_round | The average number of birdies a player makes in each PGA tour round (18 holes)                |
| driving_avg       | The average distance when driving off the tee (yds)                                           |
| gir_pct           | The percentage of greens each player reaches in regulation (GIR = Par -2 strokes)             |
| scoring_avg       | Each player's average 18-hole score (strokes)                                                 |
| scrambling_pct    | Percentage of holes that a player makes par-or-better, when failing to reach GIR (scrambling) |

### Heatmap of Player Performance Across all Metrics

First, it'd be good to get an overall viewpoint of player performance across all of our chosen metrics. A good way to visualise this is in the form of a heatmap. You can see my code at the end

```{r heatmap}

# Prepare data for the heatmap
heatmap_data <- birdies %>%
  
  # Joining respecive tables to complete dataset
  left_join(driving, by = "player") %>%
  left_join(gir, by = "player") %>%
  left_join(scoring, by = "player") %>%
  left_join(scrambling, by = "player") %>%
  select(player, birdies_per_round, driving_avg, gir_pct, scoring_avg, scrambling_pct) %>% 
  
  # Changing percentage variables, which are currently characters, to numeric
  mutate(gir_pct = as.numeric(sub("%", "", gir_pct)),
         scrambling_pct = as.numeric(sub("%", "", gir_pct))) %>% 
  
  # Changing raw value to group rank
  mutate(birdies_per_round = rank(-birdies_per_round),
         driving_avg = rank(-driving_avg),
         gir_pct = rank(-gir_pct),
         scoring_avg = rank(scoring_avg),
         scrambling_pct = rank(-scrambling_pct)) %>% 
  
  # Creating an overall rank, by summing each player's rank in all metrics, then re-ranking
  group_by(player) %>% 
  mutate(overall = sum(birdies_per_round + driving_avg + gir_pct + scoring_avg + scrambling_pct)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(overall = rank(overall)) %>% 
  filter(overall <= 30) %>% 
  
  # Longing the data for plotting
  pivot_longer(cols = c(birdies_per_round, 
                        driving_avg, gir_pct, 
                        scoring_avg, 
                        scrambling_pct), 
               values_to = "rank", 
               names_to = "metric")

# Plot the heatmap
heatmap <- ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = reorder(player, overall), y = metric, fill = rank)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  
  # Using a white to red scale, inspired by PGA colours
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "#C71230") + 
  
  # Aesthetic additions
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "PGA Player Heatmap", subtitle = "For Top 30 players in 2022/23 PGA Tour tournaments", fill = "Tour Rank") +
  pga_theme +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))

ggsave("images/heatmap.png", heatmap, width = 16, height = 8)

```

### Driving Distance vs. Birdie Rate

Modern golf is epitomized by big hitters. But... do the big hitter's make birdies more frequently? Let's take a look...

```{r birdies_driving}

# Some references
source("pga_ggplot_theme.R")

# Left join the birdies and driving datasets
birdies_distance_plot <- birdies %>% 
  left_join(driving, by = "player") %>% 

  # Create the plot using ggplot
  ggplot(aes(x = birdies_per_round, y = driving_avg)) +

  # Add line segments and labels for Kevin Kisner and Brian Stuard
  geom_segment(data = . %>% filter(player %in% c("Kevin Kisner", "Brian Stuard")),
               aes(x = birdies_per_round, y = driving_avg, 
                   xend = birdies_per_round, yend = driving_avg - 5),
               color = "white") +
  geom_text(data = . %>% filter(player %in% c("Kevin Kisner", "Brian Stuard")),
            aes(label = player, x = birdies_per_round, y = driving_avg - 6), 
            vjust = 1, color = "white", fontface = "bold") +

  # Add line segments and labels for Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm
  geom_segment(data = . %>% filter(player %in% c("Rory McIlroy", "Jon Rahm")),
               aes(x = birdies_per_round, y = driving_avg, 
                   xend = birdies_per_round, yend = driving_avg + 5),
               color = "white") +
  geom_text(data = . %>% filter(player %in% c("Rory McIlroy", "Jon Rahm")),
            aes(label = player, x = birdies_per_round, y = driving_avg + 7), 
            vjust = 1, color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  
  # Adding a smoother line, using a linear regression
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "green", se = FALSE, linetype = "longdash") +
  
  # Add scatter points with customized aesthetics
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7, color = "#003D81", shape = 21, fill = "#003D81") +

  # Set axis labels and plot titles with customized text appearance
  labs(x = "Birdies per Round", y = "Driving Distance",
       title = "Relationship between Birdies and Driving Distance",
       subtitle = "PGA Tour Players", caption = "Labels: Best and worst performers in both metrics") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "white", size = 20, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "white", size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(color = "white", size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white", size = 10),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#032544"),
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  pga_theme

# Save the plot as a PNG image
ggsave("images/birdies_distance_plot.png", birdies_distance_plot, width = 16, height = 8)

```
